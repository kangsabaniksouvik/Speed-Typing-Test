# _Speed Typing Test_
A website where you can check your _typing_ speed.

You can check the **site** here: [Speed Typing](https://kangsabaniksouvik.github.io/Speed-Typing-Test/)

The site is made using **_Github Pages_**

[**HTML**](https://github.com/kangsabaniksouvik/Speed-Typing-Test/blob/main/index.html), [**CSS**](https://github.com/kangsabaniksouvik/Speed-Typing-Test/blob/main/styles.css), and [**Vanilla JS**]() is used for the making of this site.
Two **JS** files were used, [_paragraph.js_](https://github.com/kangsabaniksouvik/Speed-Typing-Test/blob/main/paragraph.js) and [_script.js_](https://github.com/kangsabaniksouvik/Speed-Typing-Test/blob/main/script.js).

Have a good day!!!!
